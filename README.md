In this project, I analyzed an IMDB Movies dataset to determine factors influencing movie success, defined by high IMDB ratings. The analysis involved cleaning the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and performing feature engineering. I then explored the relationships between movie ratings and variables such as genre, director, budget, release year, and cast. The insights gained aim to help movie producers, directors, and investors make informed decisions for future projects.
